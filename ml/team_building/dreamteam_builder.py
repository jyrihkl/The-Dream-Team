    Builds team(s) for one or more projects based on applicant scores, motivation, and other criteria.

    If a `project_id` is provided, builds teams only for that project. Otherwise, attempts to build
    valid teams for all projects in the dataset. The resulting teams are saved to a JSON file.

    Args:
        project_id (Optional[int]): ID of the project to build a team for. If None, teams are generated
            for all available projects.
        team_size (int): Number of students to include in each team.
        applicant_data (str): Filename of the JSON file containing cleaned applicant data.
        score_data (str): Filename of the JSON file containing model-generated scores.
        motivation_score (str): Filename of the JSON file containing motivation-related scores.
        save_name (str): Name of the JSON file where the output will be saved.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary of team suggestions. Format varies depending on whether the function
        is called for a single project or all projects.

        For a single project:
            {
                "best_overall": [...],
                "perfect_team": [...],

    Raises:
        ValueError: If no valid teams can be formed for the given input.
        Exception: For unexpected runtime errors.

    Note:
        - All team suggestions are saved to `save_name` as a JSON file.
